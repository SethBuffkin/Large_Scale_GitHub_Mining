Description: GitHub has experienced exponential growth in the number of public repositories. This data represents a trove of information that can benefit researchers and industry from understanding some new aspect of development to identifying useful tools and libraries. However, processing this data can be expense as it requires both time to acquire information (e.g., a list of projects, a dump of issue tracker data, etc) from forges like GitHub. The goal of this project is to build a web platform that can instantiate queries and automatically mine data from GitHub. The platform should be able to query against GitHubâ€™s API and parse the results into a database. Additionally, it will be able to handle queries that perform simple source code analysis (e.g., looking for some keyword or string). As queries can be time consuming, the platform should execute jobs and notify a user when the job has completed. Depending on the query, the results will be available as an exported file as well as presented by a visualization.
